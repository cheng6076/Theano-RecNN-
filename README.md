# Theano-RecNN
A Theano implementation of the Recursive Neural Network (RecNN) for compositionality.

## Introduction
This code attemps to implement with Theano the standard RecNN proposed by Richard Socher.

The code is still under development. At this stage, one has to use Socher's matlab code to process a parse tree (e.g, the result of stanford parser) into a list of paired numbers, which indicate the compositional order.
